# Pitch-Control-System-of-an-Aircraft

This project is meant to find an optimal controller for a pitch control system.
A solution using a Linear Quadratic Controller (LQR) is proposed, analyzing its
performance with respect to a desired pitch angle. The result is compared with a
PI controller. 
Considering the presence of disturbances and noises (measurements noise), it has 
been introduced and defined a Kalman filter estimator and a Linear Quadratic 
Gaussian (LQG) controller has been used. 
The simulations of these systems are implemented in Matlab and Simulink
